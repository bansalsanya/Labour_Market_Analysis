# Labour_Market_Analysis
I did a Labour Market Analysis By Province in Canada for September 2024 and October 2024 to identify trends in population, employment, and unemployment rates. I used the statistics from the official website.
Here, I used Used Excel for data cleaning and processing and Tableau for creating interactive visualizations.
